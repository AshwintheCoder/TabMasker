# Tab Masker (MV3) v1.4.0
TabMasker is a Chrome extension that lets you disguise any browser tab with a custom title and favicon.

Create site rules and groups (e.g., Social, Streaming, Gaming) to automatically mask multiple sites.

Built-in Canvas-style default disguise with reliable offline data-URL icons.

Per-tab overrides, auto-group suggestions, and a persistent content script keep the mask intact even on dynamic sites like Instagram or YouTube.

Ideal for students or professionals who want to keep their workspace organized or low-key.

**New**: Groups + Auto-group suggestions.
- Starter groups: Social, Shopping, Streaming, Gaming (editable in Options).
- Per-tab > Site rule > Group precedence.
- After manual disguise, the popup offers to **Add this domain to a group** (one-click).

Install: unzip → `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked.
