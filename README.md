# TabMasker

TabMasker is a Chrome extension that lets you disguise any browser tab with a custom title and favicon.

Create site rules and groups (e.g., Social, Streaming, Gaming) to automatically mask multiple sites.

Built-in Canvas-style default disguise with reliable offline data-URL icons.

Per-tab overrides, auto-group suggestions, and a persistent content script keep the mask intact even on dynamic sites like Instagram or YouTube.

Ideal for students or professionals who want to keep their workspace organized or low-key.
